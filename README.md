## Updates

- 26-07-2025: Navigate baselines, training envs, and data generation have been added! Furthermore, long-horizon evaluation and data generation with navigation are added.
   - `ReplicaCAD` and `ReplicaCADRearrange` need to be re-downloaded from ManiSkill (see [Setup and Installation Pt 1](#setup-and-installation)). If you downloaded the `rearrange-dataset`, make sure to move it ***outside*** of `$MS_ASSET_DIR/data/scene_datasets/replica_cad_dataset` before re-downloading `ReplicaCAD` and `ReplicaCADRearrange`, as this directory will be deleted during re-download.
   - Navigation RL baselines can be downloaded from `arth-shukla/mshab_checkpoints`.
- 20-02-2025: ManiSkill-HAB has been updated to support ManiSkill3 Beta 18, resulting in **60% less memory usage**!
   - In particular, for the benchmark in Fig. 2 of the paper, MS-HAB on Beta 18 uses only ~9.68GB vram, compared to nearly 24GB previously.
   - To update, please either remove and re-clone the `mshab` branch in ManiSkill3, or pull the latest changes from the `mshab` branch in ManiSkill3. Then, `pip install -e ManiSkill` again.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Environments**

   First, set up a conda environment.
    ```bash
    conda create -n mshab python=3.9 # python>=3.9 are all supported
    conda activate mshab
    ```
  
    Next, install ManiSkill3. ManiSkill3 is currently in beta, and new changes can sometimes break MS-HAB. Until ManiSkill3 is officially released, we recommend cloning and checking out a "safe" branch:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill.git -b mshab --single-branch
    pip install -e ManiSkill
    pip install -e . # NOTE: you can optionally install train and dev dependencies via `pip install -e .[train,dev]`
    ```
  
    We also host an altered version of the ReplicaCAD dataset necessary for low-level manipulation, which can be downloaded with ManiSkill's download utils. This may take some time:
    ```bash
    # Default installs to ~/.maniskill/data. To change this, add `export MS_ASSET_DIR=[path]`
    for dataset in ycb ReplicaCAD ReplicaCADRearrange; do python -m mani_skill.utils.download_asset "$dataset"; done
    ```
  
    Now the environments can be imported to your script with just one line.
    ```python
    import mshab.envs
    ```

1. **[Optional] Checkpoints, Dataset, and Data Generation**

    The [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/arth-shukla/mshab_checkpoints) and [dataset](https://arth-shukla.github.io/mshab/#dataset-section) are all available on HuggingFace. Since the full dataset is quite large (~490GB total), it is recommended to use faster download methods appropriate for your system provided on the [HuggingFace documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/download).
    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login   # in case not already authenticated

    # Checkpoints
    huggingface-cli download arth-shukla/mshab_checkpoints --local-dir mshab_checkpoints

    # Dataset (see HuggingFace documentation for faster download options depending on your system)
    export MS_ASSET_DIR="~/.maniskill" # change to your preferred path (if changed, ideally add to .bashrc)
    export MSHAB_DATASET_DIR="$MS_ASSET_DIR/data/scene_datasets/replica_cad_dataset/rearrange-dataset"
    huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset arth-shukla/MS-HAB-TidyHouse --local-dir "$MSHAB_DATASET_DIR/tidy_house"
    huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset arth-shukla/MS-HAB-PrepareGroceries --local-dir "$MSHAB_DATASET_DIR/prepare_groceries"
    huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset arth-shukla/MS-HAB-SetTable --local-dir "$MSHAB_DATASET_DIR/set_table"
    ```
  
    Users can also generate the data with trajectory filtering by running the provided data generation script `bash scripts/gen_dataset.sh`; this option may be faster depending on connection speed and system bandwidth. Users can use custom trajectory filtering criteria by editing `mshab/utils/label_dataset.py` (e.g. stricter collision requirements, allow failure data for RL, etc).

1. **[Optional] Training Dependencies**

    To install dependencies for train scripts, simply install the extra dependencies as follows:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[train]
    ```

1. **[Optional] Dev Dependencies**

    If you'd like to contribute, please run the following to install necessary formatting and testing dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```

## Quickstart

MS-HAB provides an evaluation environment, `SequentialTask-v0` which defines tasks and success/fail conditions. The evaluation environment is ideal for evaluating the HAB's long-horizon tasks.

MS-HAB also provides training environments per subtask `[Name]SubtaskTrain-v0` which add rewards, spawn rejection pipelines, etc (e.g. `PickSubtaskTrain-v0`). Training environments do not support long-horizon tasks (i.e. no skill chaining), however they are ideal for training or evaluating individual skill policies.

To get started, you can use the below code to make your environments. Simply set the the `task`, `subtask`, and `split` variables below, add your preferred wrappers (e.g. [ManiSkill wrappers](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill/tree/main/mani_skill/utils/wrappers)), and you're good to go! For more customization, see the [Environment Configs, Implementation Details, and Customization](#environment-configs-implementation-details-and-customization) section.

```python
import gymnasium as gym

from mani_skill import ASSET_DIR
from mani_skill.vector.wrappers.gymnasium import ManiSkillVectorEnv

import mshab.envs
from mshab.envs.planner import plan_data_from_file


task = "tidy_house" # "tidy_house", "prepare_groceries", or "set_table"
subtask = "pick"    # "sequential", "pick", "place", "open", "close"
                    # NOTE: sequential loads the full task, e.g pick -> place -> ...
                    #     while pick, place, etc only simulate a single subtask each episode
split = "train"     # "train", "val"


REARRANGE_DIR = ASSET_DIR / "scene_datasets/replica_cad_dataset/rearrange"

plan_data = plan_data_from_file(
    REARRANGE_DIR / "task_plans" / task / subtask / split / "all.json"
)
spawn_data_fp = REARRANGE_DIR / "spawn_data" / task / subtask / split / "spawn_data.pt"

env = gym.make(
    f"{subtask.capitalize()}SubtaskTrain-v0",
    # Simulation args
    num_envs=252,  # RCAD has 63 train scenes, so 252 envs -> 4 parallel envs reserved for each scene
    obs_mode="rgbd",
    sim_backend="gpu",
    robot_uids="fetch",
    control_mode="pd_joint_delta_pos",
    # Rendering args
    reward_mode="normalized_dense",
    render_mode="rgb_array",
    shader_dir="minimal",
    # TimeLimit args
    max_episode_steps=200,
    # SequentialTask args
    task_plans=plan_data.plans,
    scene_builder_cls=plan_data.dataset,
    # SubtaskTrain args
    spawn_data_fp=spawn_data_fp,
    # optional: additional env_kwargs
)

# add env wrappers here

venv = ManiSkillVectorEnv(
    env,
    max_episode_steps=1000,  # set manually based on task
    ignore_terminations=True,  # set to False for partial resets
)

# add vector env wrappers here

obs, info = venv.reset()
```

## Environment Configs, Implementation Details, and Customization

### Scenes, Task Plans, etc

For simplicity, we use the following nomenclature:
- **Environments** are our `SequentialTask-v0` and `[Name]SubtaskTrain-v0` environments
- **Scenes** are the core apartment scenes from the ReplicaCAD dataset
- **Task Plans** are predefined sequences of subtasks (e.g. Pick &rarr; Place &rarr; ... ) with details on target objects/articulations, goal positions, etc
- **Spawn Data** is a precomputed list of spawn states for the robot and objects, i.e. defines the intial state distribution of the environment. These are needed since online spawn rejection pipelines (i.e. rejecting invalid spawns which contain collisions) are unstable on GPU simulation

ReplicaCAD contains 84 apartment scenes with randomized layout and furniture, with 63 allocated to the train split and 21 in the validation split. Furthermore, the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB) randomizes different YCB objects throughout the scene. For each long-horizon task (TidyHouse, PrepareGroceries, SetTable), the HAB provides 10,000 task plans for the train split and 1000 for the validation split. For each long-horizon task, each task plan has the same order of subtasks, but randomizes target objects/articulations and goal positions.

The `SequentialTask-v0` environment can load one long-horizon task at a time. Each episode, the environment samples a batch of task plans (each task plan has the same order by definition), and simulates them in parallel. This environment provides subtask success/fail conditions, but spawn rejection and rewards are not supported.

The `[Name]SubtaskTrain-v0` environments load a single subtask (Pick, Place, Open, Close) at a time. These environemnts use precomputed spawn locations for spawn rejection, and each environment defines its own dense (and normalized dense) rewards. Some training environments have additonal options which are necessary for training successful policies (e.g. `OpenSubtaskTrain-v0` has an option to randomly open the articulation 10% of the way, which is necessary to train the Open Drawer policy with online RL).

### Implementation Details

MS-HAB uses dataclasses defined in `mshab/envs/planner.py` to store environment configs, task plans, etc.
- `TaskPlan` contains a list of `[Name]Subtask` to define the subtask sequence, as well as which ReplicaCAD scene and YCB objects must be built
- Each subtask is defined with `[Name]Subtask`, which contains information about target objects/articulations, goal positions, handle positions, etc
- Success and failure conditions for each subtask are defined by `[Name]SubtaskConfig`, which contains settings for each subtask like collision force limits, place/open/close thresholds, etc

Each episode, a new task plan is sampled by the environment. The HAB task plans are saved as json files under `$MS_ASSET_DIR/data/scene_datasets/replica_cad_dataset/rearrange/`.

`[Name]SubtaskConfig`s can be passed to the environment in the `gym.make` as `task_cfgs=dict(pick=dict(...), place=dict(...), ...)` to tweak thresholds, goal types, etc for success/fail conditions.

### Simple Customization

- Tasks can be simplified by passing fewer task plans to the environment. For example, if a method is failing on the full TidyHouse tasks with all task plans, one can instead pass a single task plan for debugging and testing on a single sequence of subtasks
- Success/fail conditions can be tweaked by passing `task_cfgs` to the environment. For example, while the default Place subtask uses a sphere goal of radius 15cm, one can pass `gym.make(..., task_cfgs=dict(place=dict(goal_type="zone")))`, which allows objects to be placed in the full receptacle.

### Advanced Customization

- Tasks can be made longer/more complicated by using longer subtask sequences. However, the subtasks should be logically ordered
  - For example, the sequence "Pick &rarr; Pick" is not feasible, since the first object will still be grasped when the second Pick subtask begins. However, "Pick &rarr; Place &rarr; Pick" is feasible
  - The default spawn data downloaded in [Setup and Installation](#setup-and-installation) are generated for existing subtasks. If exisitng subtasks are reused for new task plans, then the spawn data can also be reused. If new subtasks are created, then new spawn data will need to be generated via the scripts in `mshab/utils/gen/`
- To change the split of ReplicaCAD scenes or which YCB objects are spawned, the original HAB configs need to be changed and loaded appropriately using the ManiSkill `SceneBuilder` API. As implementation can change depending on use case, please create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/arth-shukla/mshab/issues) if support is needed!

## Training

To run SAC, PPO, BC and Diffusion Policy training with default hyperparameters, you can run

```bash
bash scripts/train_[algo].sh
```

Each `scripts/train_[algo].sh` file also contains additional examples for running and changing hyperparameters.

Default train configs are located under `configs/`. If you have the checkpoints downloaded, you can train using the same hyperparameters using the included train configs by running the following:
```bash
python -m mshab.train_[algo] \
  [path-to-checkpoint-cfg]
  # optionally change specific parameters with CLI

# For example, including overriding
python -m mshab.train_sac \
  mshab_checkpoints/rl/tidy_house/pick/all/config.yml \
  algo.gamma=0.8  # overrides algo.gamma to 0.8
```

You can also resume training using a previous checkpoint. All checkpoints include model weights, optimizer/scheduler states, and other trainable parameters (e.g. log alpha for SAC). To resume training, run the following

```bash
# From checkpoint
python -m mshab.train_[algo] \
  [path-to-checkpoint-cfg] \
  model_ckpt=[path-to-checkpoint]

# For example, including overriding
python -m mshab.train_ppo \
  mshab_checkpoints/rl/tidy_house/pick/all/config.yml \
  model_ckpt=mshab_checkpoints/rl/tidy_house/pick/all/policy.pt \
  algo.lr=1e-3  # overrides algo.lr to 1e-3

# From previous run (resumes logging as well)
python -m mshab.train_[algo] \
  [path-to-checkpoint-cfg] \
  resume_logdir=[path-to-exp-dir]
```

Note that resuming training for SAC is less straightforward than other algorithms since it fills a replay buffer with samples collected during online training. However, setting `algo.init_steps=200_000` to partially refill the replay buffer can give decent results. Your mileage may vary.

## Evaluation

Note that BC and DP need a dataset to be downloaded or generated first. Evaluation using the provided checkpoints for the long-horizon tasks (with teleport nav) or individual subtasks can be done with 
```bash
bash scripts/evaluate_sequential_task.sh
```

Please note that evaluating with teleport nav is currently much slower than evaluating individual subtasks since ManiSkill3 beta does not currently support partial PhysX steps, which are needed for spawn rejection.
